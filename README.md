# What is this

This is a repo that I created to be able to show David our support ðŸ’ž for the death of a dog he held dear.

## How do I contribute?

Edit the file `script.js` in the root of the repo.

In this file, you will see a part that corresponds to you, for example, check my part and what I inserted in the different portions of it.

Since you do not know Javascript yet, there is a chance you might insert syntactical errors which will break the code. Do not worry I will fix these when needed.

You can also clone the repo locally and test your changes before pushing them to GitHub. Just use the Live Server to view the file `index.html` in the browser.

Everyone who has been invited to this repo has access and push to the `main` branch directly, to simplify things. Branching is not needed (unless you wish to change the styling, for example add more stuff and animations, feel free to).

I would like to finalise this by tonight, if possible! So we can show it to him tomorrow morning!
